# Spring Boot OAuth2 React Client

This is a example of an OAuth2 protected JavaScript based frontend with a Spring Boot REST API.

The example consists of three applications:

### Authorization Server
This is an OAuth2 Authorization Server application based on the `spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server` project.

### Frontend
This is a JavaScript frontend application based on ReactJS and using the React Bootstrap framework.

### Frontend API
This is a REST API based on Spring Boot and with an OAuth2 Client security configuration.

Look at the `WebSecurityConfig` class and the `application.yml` file for more details on the security configuration.
